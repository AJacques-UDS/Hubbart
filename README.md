# Hubbart

> NOTE: This project is brand new and the current version is probably not functional. It is strongly recommended not to use this code in production. As of January 12th, 2022, there is nothing in here.

**Hubbart** is a framework to accelerate the development of prototypes when several computing units are under consideration. A computing units refer to any IC (*Integrated Circuit*) that can perform computation, such as:

* CPU;
* GPU;
* SoC;
* Microcontroller;
* FPGA;
* DSP.

This will help areas using heterogeneous systems such as robotics or HPCs (*High-Performance Computer*).

## Use cases

The folder `usecases` will display script examples that we want to target for this framework.
